Developed at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), it provides a comprehensive suite of tools for digital elevation model (DEM) preprocessing, flow-direction modeling, watershed and stream network delineation, sink removal, floodplain mapping, and terrain analysis. Unlike traditional cartographic or visualization software, TerraHidro serves primarily as an analytical backend, seamlessly integrating with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as QGIS. The system can be used in two main ways: QGIS Plugin: For users seeking a graphical workflow, TerraHidro integrates into the QGIS Processing Toolbox, providing intuitive interfaces to execute all functionalities directly within the GIS environment; Command-Line Interface (CLI): TerraHidro operates as a stand-alone executable with no installation required. Users can run tools directly from a terminal or incorporate them into automated scripts for large-scale processing. TerraHidro supports raster data in the widely used, e.g. GeoTIFF format, and provides basic vector operations through ESRI Shapefiles. By combining high-performance processing with open-source accessibility, TerraHidro enables researchers, students, and professionals to carry out hydrological modeling, geomorphological analysis, and environmental management with precision and reproducibility. Project Highlights Graph-based flow representation that unifies local flow across digital elevation models; Drainage extraction with pit handling using methods such as Priority First Search (PFS) to remove spurious depressions and connect flow in flat areas; Large-basin workflows, with applications demonstrated for Amazon sub-basins; Flexible integration on TerraLib (C++), with bindings that enable coupling to other hydrological components; Operational efficiency from graph traversal and storage, supporting scalable accumulation and network operations; Open architecture that encourages extension and integration in broader GIS environments. QGIS Plugin Installation and Setup The TerraHidro plugin for the QGIS Processing Toolbox provides users with interfaces that allow all TerraHidro functionalities to be executed directly inside QGIS. However, please note that simply installing the plugin does not guarantee its functionality. It is also necessary to configure an environment variable named TERRAHIDRO that points to the directory where the TerraHidro executable was extracted. Installing the TerraHidro Plugin in QGIS Open QGIS. Go to Plugins &gt; Manage and Install Plugins… In the search box, type “terrahidro”. Select the TerraHidro plugin and click Install Plugin. Make sure to check the option “Show experimental plugins” under Options in the left menu. After installation, the TerraHidro plugin will appear in the Processing Toolbox. Configuring the TERRAHIDRO Environment Variable (Windows) In order for the plugin to work properly, you must configure the environment variable TERRAHIDRO to point to the directory where the TerraHidro executable (th.exe) is located. Follow these steps: Open the Control Panel Press Win + S to open the search bar. Type “Control Panel” and press Enter. Access Advanced System Settings In the Control Panel, click System and Security. Click System. On the left panel, click Advanced system settings. Open Environment Variables In the System Properties window, go to the Advanced tab. Click the Environment Variables… button at the bottom. Create a New User Variable In the User variables section, click New. Configure the Variable In the Variable name field, type: TERRAHIDRO In the Variable value field, type the full path to the directory where the TerraHidro executable is located. Example: C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\Documents\\PROGRAMS\\TerraHidro-5.2.0 Save and Close Click OK to save the new variable. Click OK again to close the System Properties window. Final Step The TERRAHIDRO environment variable is now configured in your user account, pointing to the directory of the TerraHidro executable. This allows the system to locate and execute TerraHidro from any location in the command prompt or within scripts. Important: Restart any open applications or command prompts so that they recognize the newly created environment variable. Command-Line Interface TerraHidro can be used directly from the command line, making it a flexible and efficient option for processing terrain and hydrological data. The software is distributed as a stand-alone executable, so no installation is required—just extract the files and call the program from your terminal or command prompt. Before running any operation, it is important to specify the directory where the TerraHidro executable is located. For example: We recommend placing both the input and output files in the same directory as the TerraHidro executable. This avoids path errors and ensures that the program can easily locate the required files. The structure of TerraHidro commands is designed to be simple and intuitive. Most tools follow the general pattern: th calls the TerraHidro executable. &lt;operation&gt; specifies the tool to be executed (for example, d8, removepits, pfs, minibasins). input.tif is the input raster file, usually a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). output.tif is the resulting raster file generated by the operation. For example, to remove pits from a DEM, the command would be: This straightforward structure makes TerraHidro easy to use while still offering powerful capabilities. By storing all files in the same directory and executing commands step by step, users can build reproducible workflows for DEM preprocessing, flow-direction modeling, watershed delineation, and hydrological hazard simulations. Example: Removing Pits with the pfs Operation The following example demonstrates how to use TerraHidro from the command line: C:\\data&gt;th pfs inputDEM.tif outputDEM.tif C:\\data&gt; indicates the working directory where both the TerraHidro executable (th.exe) and the raster files are stored. th calls the TerraHidro program. pfs specifies the operation to be executed. The Priority-Flood Search (PFS) algorithm is applied to remove sinks or depressions (pits) from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), generating a hydrologically consistent surface. inputDEM.tif is the input raster file containing the original DEM. outputDEM.tif is the output raster file that will be created, representing the pitless DEM. This simple command ensures that the DEM is corrected for spurious depressions, which is a fundamental preprocessing step before calculating flow directions, contributing areas, and drainage networks.  Tip – Changing the Working Directory Before running TerraHidro commands, make sure you are in the directory where the executable (th.exe) and your input/output files are located. On Windows, use the cd command: cd C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\Documents\\PROGRAMS\\TerraHidro-5.2.0 On Linux/MacOS, use: cd /home/&lt;username&gt;/PROGRAMS/TerraHidro-5.2.0 After changing to the correct directory, you can call TerraHidro tools directly, for example: th pfs inputDEM.tif outputDEM.tif "],["hydrological-analysis.html", "3 Hydrological Analysis 3.1 DEM Pre-processing and Correction 3.2 Flow Analysis, Drainage Network Extraction and Characterization 3.3 Basin and Sub-basin Delineation 3.4 Geomorphometric analysis 3.5 Applied Hydrology &amp; Risk Management", " 3 Hydrological Analysis 3.1 DEM Pre-processing and Correction This group of algorithms is designed to transform a raw Digital Elevation Model (DEM) into a hydrologically correct surface where water can flow uninterrupted to the watershed outlet. It addresses common DEM errors like pits (depressions), flat areas, and misalignments with known river networks. The output is a “pitless” and “conditioned” DEM that is essential for accurate flow direction, watershed delineation, and subsequent hydrological analysis. simplepits agreedem flatareas carvev carve fill pfs pfsd removepits 3.1.1 simplepits simplepits is an initial, targeted step for removing hydrological depressions (pits) from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) while keeping changes to the terrain as small as possible. In pit removal there are three general strategies—fill, carve/breach, or hybrid. Filling is the simplest, but applying it indiscriminately can trigger a cascade: fixing one pit creates new pits in neighboring cells, which leads to further fills and can produce artificial flat areas that were not present in the original DEM. To avoid this, simplepits focuses only on simple pits—those that can be eliminated by a single, localized elevation increase without causing any neighboring cell to become a new pit. The algorithm proceeds with a controlled trial-and-error step: it tentatively raises the pit cell by a small amount, checks the surrounding cells, and accepts the change only if no new pits appear. If any adjacent cell becomes a pit, the change is reverted and that cell is labeled a complex pit to be handled later. Operationally, it runs in linear time with respect to the number of pit cells and is intended as a conservative first pass before more comprehensive conditioning. In TerraHidro there are two functionalities for pit removal: simplepits and pfs. The simplepits functionality modifies only the pit cell. A new elevation is assigned to that cell based on the lowest neighboring elevation plus a predefined increment (in practice, 1e-3). After this increment is applied, all neighboring cells of the pit must be checked to ensure that no new pits were created. If none of the neighbors becomes a pit, the original pit is considered resolved by a simple, local operation and is classified as a simple pit. If any neighbor becomes a pit, the modification is undone and that pit cell is deferred to pfs, which handles complex pits. Figure - Simple pit resolution (a–b). (a) Initial DEM with pit cell C2 (orange) and D8 flow directions (blue). (b) C2 is raised to the lowest neighboring cell (D3) by a small increment, eliminating the pit without creating adjacent pits; the edit is accepted as a simple-pit case. Source: Jardim (2017).

When the drainage extracted from a raw DEM does not align with mapped streams, agreedem “guides” flow by sharpening (trenching/burning) the elevations along the reference network and optionally smoothing the surrounding cells within a distance buffer. This targeted editing is especially effective over low-relief and flat areas, where automatic drainage extraction is most ambiguous and computationally costly (see Clarke &amp; Burnett, 2003). agreedem is not a complete pit/flat conditioning method on its own. It only edits elevations on the reference lines and nearby cells; therefore, a hydrologically conditioned DEM (HC-DEM) still requires flat-area handling and pit removal (e.g., simplepits then pfs) so that D8 flow directions are defined everywhere. In practice, drainage data are supplied as vector lines and first converted to a raster grid; each stream cell receives an assigned “burn” value (stream burning; Wang et al., 2011), producing a gridded drainage mask that agreedem uses together with the original DEM. The reconditioning occurs in two coupled steps: Sharpening (trenching/burning): a fixed decrement is subtracted from the elevation of every drainage cell to carve a narrow channel along the reference lines. This intentionally introduces artificial micro-valleys that act as flow guides for automatic extraction. Smoothing (buffered taper): within a user-defined buffer radius (in cells) around the drainage, additional decrements are applied that decrease with distance from the line (distance-weighted). This creates a small stepped cross-section that transitions the trench back to the surrounding terrain, reducing artifacts and improving convergence of flow to the channel. Figure 3.1. Reconditioning (AgreeDEM). Cross-section example showing a 3×3 buffer where the nearest ring to the channel receives the largest decrement, the next ring a smaller decrement, and so on; the drainage cells themselves receive a larger burn depth. (Illustrative values follow the narrative.) Workflow note. After running agreedem, proceed with flat-area and pit resolution (e.g., flatareas → simplepits → pfs) to obtain a final HC-DEM suitable for D8 flow direction, contributing area, and watershed delineation.

See also: pfsd. 3.1.3 flatareas flatareas identifies contiguous regions of uniform elevation within a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The tool scans the input raster for adjacent cells possessing identical elevation values. It then groups these cells into distinct flat features. The algorithm requires a user-defined minimum area threshold, specified as a number of cells. This parameter excludes smaller, potentially insignificant flat zones from the output. The result is a raster layer where each flat area is classified, providing a basis for subsequent hydrological conditioning procedures. flatareas identifies flat areas—contiguous clusters of cells with the same elevation—and outputs a raster mask to be used in the next step (carving) so that flow lines can pass through the center of wide rivers and large flats. Flat areas are common in DEMs such as SRTM, AW3D30, and Copernicus DEM where river widths exceed grid resolution; they often appear as a “staircase” along the longitudinal profile, and every cell within a flat behaves like a pit, increasing the cost of hydrologic conditioning. By first mapping these flats, subsequent processing can dig a V-shaped channel from the edges toward the center, reducing the number of pits and guiding drainage. The original detection approach uses a simple image filter rather than an expensive region-growing segmentation. The filter has two parts: an inner 3×3 square (central test) and an outer cross (expansion). The kernel is swept from the upper-left to the lower-right of the DEM. At each position, if all cells in the inner square share the central cell’s elevation, then any cells in the outer cross that also match are marked as flat. Cells with invalid/NoData elevation (e.g., ocean mask values such as -32768) are ignored. This produces large connected flat patches efficiently. In Figure below (Identifying flat areas), intermediate steps (e.g., 26a and 26b) show the inner test and subsequent marking; by the final pass (step 112) most flat cells are identified. A few unmarked cells may remain, but they do not affect the next stage, which carves these flats. An enhanced variant uses a breadth-first flood fill (8-connected: orthogonal and diagonal neighbors), starting from each valid cell, to visit all equal-elevation neighbors exactly once. This ensures complete detection with \\(O(n)\\) complexity (each DEM cell is processed once) and naturally selects diagonal borders as well as orthogonal ones. After each component is discovered, it is retained as a flat area only if it meets the minimum size (cell count) specified by the user. Figure 3.2. Identifying flat areas. DEM cells with distinct elevations (brown) surround a flat river reach (white); gray cells are invalid/NoData (e.g., ocean/border). The 3×3 inner square (red) and outer cross (green) filter identify and mark the flat region (orange). By step 112, nearly all flat cells are tagged; any remaining unmarked cells are corrected during the subsequent carving stage. Source: Jardim (2017).

Unlike workflows that first require an explicit flat-area mask, carvev identifies flats internally and then performs the carving step; you do not need to run flatareas beforehand. The algorithm first locates the orthogonal border of each flat (only horizontal/vertical adjacencies are considered borders; neighbors marked as invalid/NoData—e.g., ocean or DEM edges—are not treated as borders). It then decrements the elevation of all border cells by a small initial step and removes those cells from the flat set. The process repeats in rounds, each time re-identifying the new orthogonal border and applying decrements, progressively moving inward until no flat cells remain. This produces a stepped V profile: higher steps at the outer edges, lower steps toward the center, so that subsequent flow-direction and contributing-area calculations follow the centerline of the river/plain rather than hugging one bank. Special handling avoids carving from ocean/border toward the interior, preventing unrealistic flow from sea to land. This pre-processing drastically reduces the number of pits in flats and accelerates downstream conditioning: after carvev, only a smaller set of residual depressions typically remains for simplepits and pfs, improving both robustness and performance.

In contrast to carvev (which converges toward the geometric center of the flat), carve can force the lowest elevations to align with mapped channels, producing flow paths that better match observed hydrography. Workflow requirement. Run flatareas first to generate the flat-area raster; pass this raster to carve together with the original DEM and the reference drainage network (if used). How it works (summary). 1) From the input flat-area mask, carve selects the border cells of each flat region according to a user-chosen neighborhood (orthogonal, diagonal, or all directions). 2) If a reference drainage is enabled, cells on the drainage within the flat are treated as the lowest targets, so the carving preferentially guides slopes toward the mapped channel. 3) The algorithm iteratively decrements border elevations and re-identifies new borders, moving inward like a stepped V-profile until the flat is removed. If drainage is not used, the carving converges toward the center (behavior similar to carvev). 4) Any remaining uncarved flat cells at the end are adjusted with the last decrement step; if drainage is active, stream cells receive the smallest (lowest) elevation to ensure convergence to the channel.

The tool uses a separate, often coarser-resolution, reference DEM to supply elevation values for these regions. This is not the same as the “fill sinks” hydrologic operation found in SAGA GIS, GRASS, etc. - This tool: fills voids where the DEM has no data (e.g., SRTM gaps). - Fill sinks (other software): alters elevations to remove hydrologic depressions in valid data. Use fill early in the workflow to produce a complete, gap-free DEM before hydrologic conditioning (agreedem, flatareas/carve or carvev, simplepits, pfs, etc.). How it works (summary). fill implements a modified Delta Surface Fill (Grohman et al., 2006): it derives a smooth difference (“delta”) between overlapping, valid portions of the input DEM and the reference DEM, then uses that delta to blend elevations seamlessly inside voids so that transitions at void boundaries are undetectable. Best practices. Make sure the input and reference DEMs are in the same projection. Parameters Flag Description dem Input DEM (GeoTIFF) with voids, e.g., inputDEM.tif. reference Reference DEM (GeoTIFF) that supplies elevations inside voids, e.g., referenceDEM.tif. output Output void-filled DEM (GeoTIFF), e.g., outputDEM.tif.

See also: simplepits, removepits. 3.1.7 pfs pfs removes depressions from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using a priority-first search algorithm. The tool initiates a grid search from each pit cell to locate the nearest spill point with a lower elevation. It employs a priority queue to evaluate potential paths, constructing a descending elevation trajectory to the outlet. This process modifies cell values along the selected path to create a hydrologically continuous surface. The algorithm ensures all depressions are resolved, producing a pit-free DEM suitable for subsequent flow-direction analysis. pfs removes all remaining depressions from a DEM by carving a path from each pit cell to an outlet cell using a Priority-First Search (PFS). Unlike simplepits, which changes only the pit cell, pfs modifies the elevations of multiple cells along a selected path so that flow can proceed continuously from the original pit to a lower cell. To minimize DEM alteration, the path is chosen to be as short as possible toward the lowest reachable elevation; if no valid interior cell is found first, the path may end at an invalid cell or at the DEM border. The DEM is treated as a graph in which each grid cell is a node and neighborhood relations (typically 8-connected) are edges. Starting at the pit (initial node), PFS explores neighboring cells using a priority queue ordered by desirability—first by lower elevation, and, in case of ties, by shorter path length from the pit. As cells are visited, the algorithm maintains a tree of paths (parent–child relations) that encodes all partial routes under consideration. When PFS reaches a final cell that satisfies the stop criteria (lower elevation and shortest distance), it commits the path from the pit to that outlet and proceeds to modify the DEM along that path. Figure - PFS search to remove a pit. The priority queue tracks, for each visited cell, its elevation, the number of steps from the pit (path length), and its parent. The final path (e.g., B2–C2–D3–D4) is committed and marked in the path tree (Jardim, 2017). Elevation modification is applied by creating a linear downslope along the chosen path: moving outward from the pit, each intermediate cell along the route receives an elevation slightly lower than its predecessor, using a small decrement step (in practice, 1e-3) applied cell by cell; the first (pit) and last (outlet) cells are not adjusted. This yields a gentle carved profile that preserves local relief while ensuring drainage continuity. To prevent creating a new pit near the outlet, PFS includes a stop condition that guarantees the computed elevation at the cell before the outlet will still be higher than the outlet’s elevation given the cumulative decrements; otherwise, the route is rejected and search continues. Border or invalid cells may also serve as terminating outlets under the stop criteria. Figure - DEM modification by a linear slope . Example before (a) and after (b) applying a constant decrement along the committed path (illustrated here with a larger step of 1e-1 for clarity), leaving the pit and outlet cells unaltered (Jardim, 2017). In practice, pfs complements simplepits: simple depressions are removed first with single-cell fills; complex ones are then resolved by PFS carving. The result is a pitless DEM suitable for reliable flow-direction, contributing-area, and drainage-network derivations, with minimal distortion relative to the original topography.

By anchoring the search to mapped channels, pfsd accelerates convergence, improves path selection near wide flats, and yields a pitless DEM whose drainage is consistent with observed hydrography. How it works (summary). - Treat the DEM as a graph (cells = nodes; 8-connected neighbors = edges). - Initialize the PFS frontier on drainage cells (vector lines rasterized internally if needed). - For each encountered pit, build a candidate tree of paths ordered by lower elevation and, on ties, shorter distance to the channel; commit the first path that satisfies the outlet criteria. - Carve a gentle linear downslope along the committed path (small per-cell decrements), ensuring continuous flow from the pit to the outlet without over-smoothing. - Iterate upstream until no depressions remain. When to use. Choose pfsd when a reference drainage is available and you want pit removal to follow mapped channels. For projects without a drainage reference, use pfs. Workflow note. A common conditioning chain is: agreedem (optional) → flatareas + carve (or carvev) → simplepits → pfsd. Using pfsd at the end aligns remaining pit removal with the reference drainage, improving hydrologic realism and efficiency.

It is the preferred one-pass procedure when you want a pitless DEM without supplying a reference drainage network. What it does (three phases). removepits internally executes, in sequence: carvev — identifies flat areas and carves them V-shaped from the borders toward the center, guiding flow through the flat midline and drastically reducing the number of depressions in these regions; simplepits — applies selective single-cell filling to remove only those depressions that can be fixed by a minimal local raise without creating new pits; pfs — uses Priority-First Search to carve a gentle downslope path from any remaining (complex) pits to an outlet cell, completing the elimination of depressions. By combining targeted fill sinks (phase 2) with controlled carving (phases 1 and 3), removepits is a hybrid method designed to preserve local relief while producing reliable D8 flow directions across the entire grid. Parameters Flag Description dem Input DEM (GeoTIFF) (e.g., inputDEM.tif). output Output pitless DEM (GeoTIFF) with flats carved and simple/complex pits removed (e.g., `outputDEM.tif).

Notes. • Ties are uncommon after proper conditioning; if present, the tool resolves to one neighbor or yields 0 when no descent exists. • Cells touching NoData or the DEM boundary may legitimately output 0. • The D8 flow direction is the basis for contributing area, stream extraction, stream ordering, and watershed delineation. Parameters Flag Description dem Input hydrologically conditioned DEM (GeoTIFF) (e.g., inputDEM.tif). output Output D8 flow direction raster (GeoTIFF) (e.g., flowdir.tif).

This produces a raster in which hillslopes have small values and channels concentrate large values. Prerequisite. Use a D8 flow-direction raster produced by d8 from a hydrologically conditioned (pitless) DEM. Figure. Contributing area derived from a D8 grid. Behavior &amp; output - Method: Single-flow-direction (SFD): each cell routes its discharge to one downslope neighbor (O’Callaghan &amp; Mark, 1984). - Default units: cell counts (number of upslope cells). - NoData handling: cells with NoData in the input D8 raster become NoData in the output. Parameters Flag Description input Input D8 flow-direction raster (GeoTIFF) (e.g., inputD8.tif). output Output D8 contributing area (GeoTIFF) (e.g., outputD8ContributingArea.tif).

Each cell is assigned 1 (stream) if its contributing area is greater than or equal to the specified threshold, and 0 otherwise. The result is a binary stream grid suitable for stream ordering, vectorization, and watershed delineation. Figure - Drainage network derived from a D8 contributing-area grid using a minimum-area threshold. Prerequisite. Use a contributing-area raster produced by d8ca from a hydrologically conditioned DEM and its corresponding d8 flow directions. Choosing the threshold (guidance) - The threshold represents the minimum upslope area needed to initiate/maintain a channel (area used as a surrogate for discharge). - Smaller thresholds ⇒ denser networks; larger thresholds ⇒ sparser networks. - There is no universal value: it depends on terrain, climate, lithology, and grid resolution. - Common practice: inspect maps/imagery, test a range of values, and select the one that best matches known channels. Behavior &amp; data handling - Input NoData cells remain NoData in the output (not classified as streams). - Threshold is provided in cells (i.e., count of upslope cells). Parameters Flag Description input Input D8 contributing area raster (GeoTIFF), (e.g. inputContributingArea.tif). output Output binary drainage network raster (GeoTIFF) (e.g., outputDrainage.tif (1 = stream, 0 = non-stream). thresholdValue Minimum contributing area (in cells) to classify a cell as stream. The following example demonstrates how to use d8ca tool from the command line: th d8drainage inputContributingArea.tif outputDrainage.tif thresholdValue Example: th d8drainage d8ca.tif drainage.tif 2000 Tip Start with a broad sweep (e.g., 300, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 cells), compare against known hydrography or high-resolution imagery, then refine the threshold for your study area.. See also: d8, d8ca. 3.2.4 d8drainagev d8drainagev converts a binary drainage raster (e.g., from d8drainage) into vector polylines by following the D8 flow-direction raster. The tool traverses stream cells from sources (no inflowing neighbors) downstream along the D8 directions, assembling connected cell pairs into line features that represent stream segments. How it works (summary). - Reads the drainage raster (1 = stream, 0 = non-stream; NoData ignored) and the matching D8 direction raster. - Detects headwater cells (stream cells with no upstream contributors) and traces downstream paths by following the D8 pointer of each cell. - Builds polyline features for each connected path; branching and confluences are preserved by starting new lines as needed. - Outputs a vector line dataset suitable for ordering, attribution, and cartographic display. Parameters Flag Description drainage Input drainage network raster (GeoTIFF), e.g., inputDrainage.tif (1 = stream, 0 = else). d8 Input D8 flow-direction raster (GeoTIFF), e.g., inputD8.tif. output Output vector drainage network (e.g., ESRI Shapefile), e.g., outputDrainage.shp. Notes • Ensure the drainage raster is topologically coherent with the D8 grid (both produced from the same DEM). • The drainage grid and D8 grid must share the same extent, pixel size, and alignment • NoData and non-stream cells are skipped; only cells marked as stream are traced. • The resulting lines can be post-processed (e.g., smoothing, ordering, attribute joins) according to project needs.
