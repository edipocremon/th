# License {#license}

**TerraHidro** is released under the **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 3 or later**.  
This means you may **use, copy, modify, and redistribute** TerraHidro—commercially or non-commercially—provided you comply with the LGPL terms.

**What this permits**

- **Free use and redistribution.** You can distribute TerraHidro (source or binaries) and include it in your projects.
- **Modify and share improvements.** If you change TerraHidro itself (the “Library”), you must license those changes under **LGPL-3.0+** and keep notices intact.
- **Link in applications.** You may link TerraHidro with your own Application (proprietary or open). The Application can be under a different license, as long as users retain the ability to relink/replace the TerraHidro library with a modified version.

**Key obligations (summary)**

- **Notices & copies.** Distribute TerraHidro with a prominent notice that it uses the LGPL-licensed Library and include copies of the LGPL v3 and the GPL v3 license texts.
- **Header usage in object code.** If object code from your Application includes more than trivial material from TerraHidro’s headers, you must provide the above notices and license copies.
- **Combined Works.** If you ship an Application linked with TerraHidro (a Combined Work), do not restrict users from modifying the LGPL parts or from reverse-engineering solely to debug their modifications.
- **Relinking option.** Provide one of the following:
  - the Minimal Corresponding Source of the LGPL components and the Corresponding Application Code sufficient to let users relink with a modified TerraHidro; or
  - use a suitable shared-library mechanism so users can drop in a compatible modified TerraHidro at runtime.
- **Installation Information (when required).** If the GPL would require installation information for user products, provide it to the extent needed for users to install and run a modified TerraHidro in your Combined Work.
